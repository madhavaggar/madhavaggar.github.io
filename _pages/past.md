I graduated from the National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli in 2022 as the **Best Outgoing Student**. I was affiliated with <a href="https://sites.usc.edu/prasanna/">Prof. Viktor K. Prasanna's</a> research group at the Viterbi School of Engineering, funded by the IUSSTF Viterbi Fellowship, to work on memory and computation-intensive problems in **Graph Representation Learning** using innovative algorithm-architecture mapping approaches. <br/>

Prior to that I interned at the <a href="https://iitgn.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar</a>. Here, I was introduced to Graph Representation Learning by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/anirbandasgupta/">Prof. Anirban Dasgupta</a> who encouraged me to tackle the challenge of scaling Graph Neural Networks. <br/>

I am a recipient of the **Sri Janardhana Iyengar Memorial Award**, the **Tezos Global Fellowship** and <a href="https://webjapps.ias.ac.in/fellowship2021/index.html">the Indian Academy of Sciences Research Grant</a>. <br/>

Our actions should have a direct impact on people's lives! Aside from contributing through Research, I love **volunteering**! More than 7000 students entrusted me with the responsibility to impact their lives and the city of Tiruchirappalli in April 2021 as I was elected the as the Student President of my university. I was also blessed to have founded **HOPE**, a community for the betterment of students struggling with mental health issues, along with a beautiful set of people from Virginia Tech, IIT Madras, and NIT Trichy.
