I am a second-year Master's student at **Cornell University** majoring in Computer Science, specializing in Computer Vision and Machine Learning, and currently working on DDoS Attack Detection using Large Language Models at A10 Networks. My research interests lie at the intersection of Computer Vision and Graphics. More specifically I work on applications of Generative Vision Models in diverse data domains and training models that can learn from limited supervision. I work with Prof. Abe Davis and his Research Group. <br/>
