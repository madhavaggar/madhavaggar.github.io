I am a second-year Master's student at **Cornell University** majoring in Computer Science, specializing in Computer Vision and Deep Learning, and currently working on Interactive Sampling for Diffusion Models and Satellite Event Discovery. My research interests lie at the intersection of **Computer Vision and Graphics**. More specifically I work on applications of Generative Vision Models in diverse data domains and training models that can learn from limited supervision in multimodal settings. I work with **Prof. Bharath Hariharan** and **Prof. Abe Davis**. Updates from my time in California this summer, working at A10 Networks soon!<br/>
